The NIE library always puts out interesting books on the shelves and [Epic Classroom by Trevor Muir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35560006-the-epic-classroom) caught my eye last week.

The premise of the book is simple: *narratives* should act as metaphors for us to design curriculum, units of learning, and individual lessons to boost student engagement. Specifically, *epic narratives* - narratives centered around a hero and a spectacular conflict - allow students to take charge of their own learning as they feel that the tasks they do are vested with a special purpose beyond the classroom. 

## How this might change teaching and learning
Muir frames "epic learning" (26) through the five elements which make up a story:


### Theme (key concepts) 
The central idea that links all story components together. Muir sees a convergence between "theme" and what is traditionally labelled in syllabus documents as "key concepts". Just as themes run through all parts of one coherent story, he suggests that teachers should see how their planned activities bring out the theme. For instance, he cites the example of "modernity" as a theme in the US Common Core History syllabus. Whether the lesson involves writing an essay on lifestyle and cultural changes during the Industrial Revolution, or interviewing elderly folk on the technological changes in their lifetime, it should all relate back to the central theme in a way that is obvious to students.

### Plot (activities)
The sequence of interrelated events in a story. This is probably the most powerful part of the story metaphor for teaching and learning, as it compels teachers to think of their lessons as interconnected in such a way that each lesson builds suspense for the next. Just like a plot curve, the highest point of learning occurs when students achieve the overall learning outcome, and Muir argues for the importance of the sequence of activities and lessons in creating momentum for it. 

In the same way plots have an exposition, conflict and resolution, so also should plans for a unit of learning. The exposition - or introduction - is when students are introduced to the central *conflict* and their *role* in the story. 

### Conflict (success criteria / deliverables)
The main issue or problem that requires action from the hero (students). Muir is a big advocate of "show, not tell", and so talks about exposing students to real-world people and problems, and getting students to generate the "conflict" for themselves. He does so by inviting community partners to show the real-world relevance of the theme (concept) he is teaching. For example, through a local social work agency, he invited a Rwandan refugee to share her experiences adapting to life in the US, to teach the concept of modernity. By comparing her life story with their own, students could see the possible problems modernity might pose for certain groups of people, and independently generated ideas on the specific problems posed by modernity and ways to solve them. 

### Characters (role of students)
The people (or animals/objects) that take part in a story. The sentience and 
### Setting (classroom design)





## But... can it apply to my classroom?
